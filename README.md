# Sign-up-Form
This project is a sign up form made using html, css, and javascript following a design provided by The Odin Project.

There are a lot of lessons in The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS course before they give you a project so I am quite excited to make this.

I used the flexbot layout to acheive the same layout as the design's.
